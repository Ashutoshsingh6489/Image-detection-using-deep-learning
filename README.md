## Introduction
With advancements in deep learning and AI, image detection has become an essential tool across multiple domains. Image detection involves recognizing objects, patterns, and features in digital images and classifying them into predefined categories.

This project develops an image detection system using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. The system is trained on a dataset and can identify objects in images or real-time video streams. The primary aim is to achieve high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The real-world applicability of this technology spans numerous industries, including security, healthcare, industrial automation, and agriculture.

## Theory
Image detection is a subset of computer vision that focuses on identifying objects within an image. The primary techniques used in image detection include:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** A class of deep learning models designed for image recognition tasks, using convolutional layers to detect spatial hierarchies in images.
- **Feature Extraction:** Identifying key features such as edges, textures, and shapes.
- **Classification:** Assigning labels to detected objects using trained models.
- **Object Localization:** Determining the precise position of objects within an image.
- **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS):** Reducing duplicate bounding boxes to refine detection accuracy.
- **Bounding Box Regression:** Estimating the exact position of an object in an image.
- **Transfer Learning:** Using pre-trained models to enhance accuracy and reduce training time.
- **Data Augmentation:** Applying transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping to improve model generalization.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Fine-tuning parameters like learning rate and batch size to enhance performance.
- **Object Detection Algorithms:** Techniques such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), Faster R-CNN, and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) to improve efficiency.
- **Edge Detection & Segmentation Techniques:** Methods like Mask R-CNN provide detailed object localization.
- **Optical Flow:** Tracking moving objects in video-based detection applications.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Image Sequences:** Utilizing temporal relationships between video frames.
